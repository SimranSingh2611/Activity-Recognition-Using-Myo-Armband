# Activity-Recognition-Using-Myo-Armband


In this project, we attempted to develop a computing system that can understand human activities. There are a few components to understanding human activities: a) identify known activities, b) segment sequence of activities, and c) identify unknown activities. We will attempt to solve all three aspects. 

There were three phases: 
1. Data Collection
2. Feature Extraction
3. Feature Selection
